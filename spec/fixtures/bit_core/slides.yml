  title: This is just the beginning...
  body: For the next few days, let's start by making you aware of some of the things you do every day.


    Be honest. No cheating. No judgments, no worries--just a little bit of work. Just, let us know a bit about what you've been up to...


    We just want you to know that we know this is a bit tedious.

    But bear with us. If you can keep this up for a few days it will be really helpful later.

  title: Meet Jim
  body: "When Jim started with ThinkFeelDo, the first thing he noticed was the recent
    change in his behavior – how he no longer did many activities that make him happy.

    Continuing to use ThinkFeelDo, Jim learned that scheduling in anything that he would enjoy
    doing into his evening – a hobby, some exercise, time to sit down with his daughter
    - would help him work into his day activities he enjoyed. He made sure to build
    in time for activities that he would rate 5+ on the Pleasure scale, and 3+ on
    the Accomplishment scale, at least a couple times per week.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOver
    the next few weeks, Jim was able to schedule in a number of activities during
    the evenings. He would still sit in his chair to relax, but only for a 30-minute
    TV show “rest break”. Then he would get up to walk the dog. Soon he was walking
    a full hour with him! On other nights of the week, Jim would go out to
    the garage and work on his car, or spend some time reading a book. He also asked
    his wife to schedule a couple of dinners a week at a later time, so he could join
    the family when he got home from work. Jim noticed that he actually looked
    forward to getting in the car and commuting home for the evenings. He also found
    himself going to bed earlier and sleeping better on nights that he took time to
    do things he enjoyed, saying, “Its amazing what a difference it makes just getting
    out of that chair and doing something that makes me feel good.”\r\n\r\nSee what
    good can come from just starting to monitor the activities you do - or used to
    do? Follow along in the \"Do\" tool and the next few lessons to learn how ThinkFeelDo
    can help you, too."
